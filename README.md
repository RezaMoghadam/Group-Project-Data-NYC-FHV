### NYC FHV Trip Data Analysis â€“ DSC 232 Group Project

## Milestone One
## Project Overview
This project explores New York City's High Volume For-Hire Vehicle (FHV) data (Uber, Lyft, etc.) from 2019 to 2022 using PySpark for large-scale analysis.


## Dataset
Source: NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission

Format: Parquet (~19 GB compressed)

Services: Uber, Lyft, Via, Juno

[Data Dictionary (PDF)](data_dictionary_trip_records_hvfhs.pdf)

## Milestone Two 
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


Loaded and processed using PySpark on the San Diego Supercomputer (SDSC)

Cleaned rows with nulls and invalid values

Explored patterns in trip duration, distance, tips, and driver pay

Visualized demand by time, trip metrics, and correlations


## Preprocessing Steps


Dropped rows with nulls in trip_miles, trip_time, driver_pay

Removed trips with 0 distance or 0 fare

Filtered outliers to improve data quality

Selected relevant features for analysis



## Milestone Three
Linear Regression Model

## Original Full Pipeline Notebook
Preprocessing of data  
Training a LR model

Conclusion on Milestone 3  


## Environmental Setup and Data Download
We use PySpark to process the NYC For-Hire Vehicle (FHV) dataset on SDSC's Expanse platform.  
The environment is configured with increased memory and executor resources to handle the large-scale data efficiently.

This setup includes:
- PySpark 
- Spark session initialization with custom memory and executor settings
- Configuration for parallel processing

```python
import pyspark
print("Using PySpark version:", pyspark.__version__)

from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .config("spark.driver.memory", "8g") \
    .config("spark.executor.memory", "8g") \
    .config("spark.executor.instances", "5") \
    .config("spark.executor.cores", "2") \
    .getOrCreate()
```

Only the Notebook for Milestone 2 includes the necessary packages and a cell to download the data locally.  
The rest of the notebooks assume that the data is in the local (Data) folder.

Below cell installs the packages 

```python
%pip install pyspark pandas matplotlib seaborn
```
